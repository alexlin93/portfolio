# Portfolio Website #

## Current Status ##
I'm in the process of turning this into my personal site!

## Introduction ##
In the beginning, my goal for this project was to create a responsive website for a design mockup: https://storage.googleapis.com/supplemental_media/udacityu/2655898586/design-mockup-portfolio.pdf . Since then I've motified the content and a bit of the structure to display my personal projects and work as a developer. Most of the content is from Udacity's Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree.

## Content ##
* At least 4 responsive images at all screen sizes
* Semantic and nonsemantic tags
* Custom font and styles
* Flexbox layout with Bootstrap
* Content that is responsive and displays on all display sizes
* File structure of directories is separated based on functionality
* HTML and CSS meet specifications and pass validators

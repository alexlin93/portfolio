## Introduction ##
In the beginning, my goal for this project was to create a responsive website for a design mockup: https://storage.googleapis.com/supplemental_media/udacityu/2655898586/design-mockup-portfolio.pdf . Since then I've motified the content and a bit of the structure to display my personal projects and work as a developer.

## What you'll find ##
* Responsive content
* Good HTML and CSS code with semantic and nonsemantic tags
* Custom font and styles
* Smooth, flexbox layout with Bootstrap
